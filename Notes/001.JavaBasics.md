## Java Background

### Who/What is Java?
Java is an object-oriented programming language designed to develop all 
kind of applications like mobile,web and desktop.

Java was invented in 1991 but the first version of java was released in 1996 by Sun MicroSystems.
James Gosling created Java and its currently being maintained by Oracle Corporation.
The name Java is inspired by the java coffee beans, strong coffee = strong programming language.

### Advantages/Disadvantages of Java
- Simple Language
- Object-Oriented, designed to develop any sort of application
- Platform-independent, no neet to worry about OS
- Distributed, you can divide between different servers etc
- Secure, you can give permissions to see which class can be seen or not.
- Robust, easy to extend an application in the future. 
- UI is the only problem with Java, proper logic and everything but lacks here

### Different technologies in Java

**Java SE**: Java Standard Edition, this edition can be used for building standalone applications

**Java EE**: Java Enterprise Edition, used a lot in e-commerce, banking

**Java SE**: Java Micro Edition, this is used to build mobile related, embedded system like bank/coffee machines.

### What is Core Java?
Just focused on CORE programming, it's the actual java programming ,and it is for any kind of 
application development. It is also used in software testing field, mostly in automation.

### What is the Java Development Kit?

Java Development Kit (JDK) is a cross-platform software development kit that provides tools and libraries needed to build Java-based applications and applets. It works together with the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and JRE (Java Runtime Environment) as part of the core Java setup.

- The JDK includes everything required for Java development — compilers, debuggers, and other essential tools.
- Beginners often get confused between JRE and JDK.
- If you only want to run Java programs, installing JRE is enough.
- But if you want to develop Java applications, you’ll need the JDK, which includes the JRE and additional development tools.
