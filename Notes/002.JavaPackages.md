Basic Idea about Packages: Imagine if there wasn't any segregation with bus stops, there could be any bus travelling
to any place that reaches at certain stop. Wouldn't it be better if you knew what bus goes where and their stop.
Similarly, if you have so many Java files in one place, it's frustrating to have them in one single place.  

So, if the actual project is a container, packages are sub containers. Packages will also help you save two files 
with same name. 

A folder/package/container holds all the Java files, you can, and you should have multiple packages
as per the complexity of the project. A java package should be all **lowercase**. 
This is NOT a rule,but it is a convention.

Inside the packages are our Java classes, Java classes start with an Upper case and don't have any spaces,
because java does not allow it. `GrossPayCalculator`

you can use . to automatically create different directories, for example `.com.subtitles.english` & `.com.subtitles.spanish`
will not just create these two packages but first .com then subtitles and finally the english and spanish package. 

```java
package gross_calculator;  //If our class is under a package, which it is we must first declare it

// Next is the class declaration with curly braces. 
public class GrossPayCalculator {  
}
```
