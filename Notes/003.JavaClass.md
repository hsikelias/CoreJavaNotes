# What is a class?

Class is like a blueprint, if you're planning to construct your house before actually building
it, ideally you would first create a blueprint of it. You will have the plan, but
not the actual bed/house. Because it's just a document. 

Similarly, to execute any logic in java, first you have to document all the actions to perform
and information to save.  

Every class has a name, method and variables.
```java
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) { // shortcut is to use main and hit ctrl + space
System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```
- public/private are an accessibility modifiers. 
- the syntax "static void main(String[]args)" are important to have to run properly.
- We can have n number of methods and variables inside a class.

### Superclass
For every class we need a superclass, like a parent body. For classes in Java, the super class
is an Object. So every class you create it's superclass is Object.
