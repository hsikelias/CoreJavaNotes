## Decision Statements

#### Syntax

````
switch (key){
  case value:
    //statements
    break;
  default:
    // statements
    break;
}
````
in if/else you verify based on a condition directly but in switch it depends on a value. Each case represents one value, by default we should have a default value as well.
