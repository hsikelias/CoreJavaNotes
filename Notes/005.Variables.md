## What is a Variable?
To store any data as a container to access it later

``` java
package firstPackage;

public class variable {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // DataType variableName = variableValue;
    // Defining vs Initializing
    int pinCode; // Container Defined
    pinCode = 50234; // Value Initialized

    // We can reassign values inside a variable as well. 
    pinCode = 345234;
    
    System.out.println(pinCode);
  }
}

```
## Different types of Variables
There are 4 types of variables in java: 
- Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)
- Class Variables (Static Fields)
- Local Variables
- Parameters

1. **Instance Variables( Non- Static Fields):** 

These are made in class level, not in method level. It's just a recomendation to keep the variable sinside the beginning of class level. 

```java
package firstPackage;

public class Student {
  // Instance variables( Non Static)
  int id = 101; // we call this as an instance variable because only if we create an object for it we can use it in methods. Else we can NOT make a static reference to the non-static field id
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  // class name variable name = new key word Constructor();  
    Student Student = new Student();
    System.out.println(Student.id);
  }
}
```
2. **Static Fields:** These are similar to instances, we create them in class but we use a key word called "static" beofre the data type. And for this you don't need to setup a new object like we did in instances. 

```java
public class Student {
  // Instance variables( Non Static)
  int id = 101; 

  static int id2 = 1001;
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Student Student = new Student();
    System.out.println(Student.id);
    System.out.println(id2);
    
  }

  public static void test1(){
    System.out.println(id2);
  }
}
```

3. **Local Variables:** Creating a variable inside a method. A variable inside one method can NOT be used in another method. You cant use static or instance.  


4. **Parameters:** Thees are directly inside our method's definition. Like (String[] args) is an example 
  #Note: The String[] args parameter in the Java main method serves as a mechanism to pass command-line arguments to your Java program when it is executed.

You can assign values in local variable but for parameter you cant, you only define.
Below is how you assign a value to it.

``` Java
public class Student {
  // Instance variables( Non Static)
  int id = 101; // we call this as an instance variable because only if we create an object for it we can use it in methods. Else we can NOT make a static reference to the non-static field id

  static int id2 = 1001;
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  // class name variable name = new key word Constructor();  
    Student Student = new Student();
    System.out.println(Student.id);
    System.out.println(id2);
    test1(70); //Initializing 
  }

  public static void test1(int height){
    System.out.println(height);
  }
}
```

## Naming Conventions for Variables

Variables are case sensitive in Java

``` Java
static String name = "Bob";
static String NAME = "Builder";
```
These two are different variables holding their own assigned value. 

```Java
static String name = "Bob2";
static String firstName = "Builder";
String statePhoneDirectory = "test";
```
Here name is one word and every variable that just has one word in java should be all lowercase. If more than one word should be in **camel case**.

Keywords you can't use are like void, class, public. You can modify with adding new text or number but you cant use directly.
