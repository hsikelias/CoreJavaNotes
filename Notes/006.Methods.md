# Methods

Whenever we are building anything we try to resonate our java files context with how it will work in real world. If an object has some properties in real world, in java those are usually variables, and behaviors are methods. 

## What is a method?

Block of code created for performing any action or operation under a class. Each method should make sense to belong in that class. 
## How do we create a method?

#### Syntax for writing a method

``` java
**accessModifier** staticOrNonStatic **returnType methodName** (parameters) throws ExceptionList 
{
// Only the highlighted ones are important, rest are optional 
// public is one of the access modifiers
// we specify which value to return

return value; 
}
```
Your Program will only run if you have a main method.

```java
package firstPackage;

public class Bank {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

  }

  public static void greetCustomer(){
  // use void when returning any data type
  // below is the method body
  System.out.println("Hello, How are you");
  }

}

```
Above, you can see there is the main method, empty main method and still when u run the program it doesnt do the intended task. 
Thats because by default, you can only execute the main method in Java, To perform actions in the other method, you need to call that method inside your main method. 

We can call the other method in main methdo by calling its name with (); This works because both of our methods are static. If they weren't we would need to convert them to objects and do seperate shit. 

``` java
package firstPackage;

public class Bank {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  greetCustomer();
  }

  public static void greetCustomer(){
  // use void when returning any data type
  // below is the method body
  System.out.println("Hello, How are you");
  }

}

```
To use a non static method, we dont need to use any non static key word, leaving it will be considered as non static by default. 


``` java
package firstPackage;

public class Bank {
  static int currentBalance = 1000;
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  greetCustomer();
  deposit(5000);
  }

  public static void greetCustomer(){
  // use void when returning any data type
  // below is the method body
  System.out.println("Hello, How are you");
  }

  public void deposit(int amount){
  // here the customer inptus money amount to deposit, if any method works on an input we need to use parameters.
    currentBalance = currentBalance + amount;

  }

  public static void withdrawal(int amount){
    currentBalance = currentBalance - amount;
  
  }

  public int getCurrentBalance(){
    // no inputs only returning values. 
    return currentBalance;

  }

}

```
Notice how in this code above, the deposit method is non static, for that reason when we try to call in our main method, which is static.. it throws an error message at us. So basically we cant keep static and non static together without an object. 

## What are the parameters?

## What is the return type?
