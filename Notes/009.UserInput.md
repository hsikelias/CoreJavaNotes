## User Input

``` java
package firstPackage;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class UserInput {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
            # var name    #where are we scanning from
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
  }
}
```
- To use the in built scanner class in java we need to create an object. 
- We can use scanner for multiple things, like scanning a file, reading user input.. mostly people use it for user input. 
- new key word
- We are scanning things as an input so System.in is our keyword

``scanner.nextInt();`` , to read users input we should identify the data type
