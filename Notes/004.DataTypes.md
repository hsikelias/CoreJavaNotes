## What is a data type?

```java
public String breed = "German Shepard";  // This is how u can create a variable
public int height = 30;
public int weight = 35;
```
- Above, the name of the variable is "breed" and the data its storing is "German Shepard",
and it's holding a string. Here the data type is string.
- In height the variable is storing an integer so the variable's data type is int. 
- Every data type specifies the memory length and the type of data it stores. 
- Certain data types are meant to hold specific type of data, like the `String` data type can't
hold a number.
- Before actually naming the variable name we specify the data type.
